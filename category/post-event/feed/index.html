				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/roxLjohnson">Roxanne Johnson</a></p>
<p>Yesterday I attended <a href="http://capitolcode.mn.gov/">Capitol Code</a>: an Open Data<br />
Jam put on by the Secretary of State’s Office. The event was focused on<br />
showcasing the possibilities of using public data to solve community problems,<br />
drive innovation and entrepreneurship, and make information more accessible to<br />
residents of Minnesota.</p>
<p>After a kick-off from Mark Ritchie, about 12 people pitched ideas of projects<br />
to work on for the day. People pitched ideas like an app to tell people how<br />
long their wait at the poll is going to be on election day, collecting social<br />
media feeds for state legislators all in one place, mapping boundary water<br />
canoe trips, and more. The group I ended up in was interested in collecting all<br />
of the public data in the state in one place and making a kind of data gateway.</p>
<p>Our group ended up being three groups that partially merged; the data gateway<br />
idea, an idea to use web applications for data visualizations, and making a<br />
visual application that showed where our tax dollars go. We were tasked with<br />
presenting our work at the end of the day and telling the larger group about<br />
our problem, solution, work, data, and team bios. Our problem: public data in<br />
Minnesota is not all in one place and in an accessible format.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we identified two major subproblems to our problem: the<br />
problem for the state of hosting accessible data in one place, and the problem<br />
for end users (in this case developers), which is how to find out about and get<br />
access to the data available in a useful format.</p>
<p>After a bit of discussion, we decided to be two separate groups each working on<br />
a subproblem, but together. One group focused on the more back-end problem of<br />
collecting, hosting, and cataloging the data. The second group worked on an<br />
idea of making a template for front-end analytics that would allow developers<br />
to visualize the data more easily to see trends or just explore the data set.</p>
<p>Somewhere in our work, we grabbed onto the idea of the ecosystem- Bill Bushey<br />
had used the word early in the day while talking about the vast system of data<br />
the Census Bureau operates. The framework of an ecosystem of public data<br />
allowed solutions to our two problems to fit into a bigger system together.<br />
This system became a kind of elegant solution to the larger problem: making<br />
data available and accessible in one place allows developers to use the data<br />
easily and then share the data or lessons learned from the data with the public<br />
taxpayers who financed the data collection. Having a single “store” to get data<br />
from allows the state, who hosts the store, to gather analytics on data usage,<br />
which can better inform future data collection and dissemination, which makes<br />
things even easier for developers to do more in the future.</p>
<p>Since ecosystems work in loops, we decided to use Prezi in our presentation<br />
back to the large group. Prezi allowed us to show the whole system and zoom in<br />
to talk about details of each part and then show how the parts connect to the<br />
larger system. You can find our Prezi<br />
<a href="http://prezi.com/bcz4m35brttp/capitol-code-22214/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">here</a>.</p>
<p>While other groups made applications or websites, we made a conceptual<br />
framework that shows a cohesive way to think about a system of public data in<br />
Minnesota. This framework allows us to see that a healthy system where each<br />
piece is designed within the larger context of the system cold maximize the<br />
benefit we gain from collecting the data in the first place. Increased access<br />
and usability means that more people with different perspectives can use the<br />
data to answer more diverse questions, leading to more complete knowledge and<br />
increased engagement.</p>
<p>This framework also allows us to identify where the barriers are; in the<br />
presentation Q&amp;A, Dave answered a question about why this system hasn’t been<br />
implemented yet by saying that the problem is probably not technical. It could<br />
be political or organizational; in our discussion we had talked about how<br />
creating this system requires champions to work across agencies, departments,<br />
and the legislature.</p>
<p>I’m not a super technical person and I have to admit there were times that I<br />
got lost in the conversations about APIs and the Javascript D3 library. That<br />
said, I love working with conceptual frameworks, understanding the big picture<br />
system, and connecting what individual experts say about their pieces of a<br />
complex system. I also enjoy using tools, like Prezi, that have the<br />
functionality to highlight the interconnectivity that we identified in the<br />
system. I had a lot of fun with our group and felt like we each contributed<br />
very different things, which I like to think of as a mini-version of what we<br />
identified to be as necessary to build this kind of integrated, healthy public<br />
data ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some of the cool examples we looked at:</p>
